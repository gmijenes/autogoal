# AutoGOAL examples

The following examples illustrate the use of AutoGOAL is more practical scenarios.

These three examples conform the experimentation for the paper
`Solving Heterogenous AutoML Problems with AutoGOAL` presented at the 7th Workshop on AutoML in ICML 2020.

* [Optimizing seven UCI repository datasets](./tests.examples.solving_uci_datasets.md)
* [Optimizing the HAHA 2019 challenge](./tests.examples.solving_haha_2019.md)
* [Optimizing the MEDDOCAN 2019 challenge](./tests.examples.solving_meddocan_2019.md)

The following examples test AutoGOAL's neural architecture search (NAS) capabilities on common datasets:

* [Solving CARS with Keras](./tests.examples.nn_cars.md)
* [Solving MEDDOCAN with Keras](./tests.examples.nn_meddocan.md)
