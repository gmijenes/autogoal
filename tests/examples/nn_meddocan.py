# # Solving the MEDDOCAN challenge with Keras

# This script runs an instance of [`AutoML`](/api/autogoal.ml#automl)
# in the [MEDDOCAN 2019 challenge](https://github.com/PlanTL-SANIDAD/SPACCC_MEDDOCAN).
# The full source code can be found [here](https://github.com/autogoal/autogoal/blob/main/docs/examples/solving_meddocan_2019.py).

# In this example we only want to test the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) capabilities of AutoGOAL.
