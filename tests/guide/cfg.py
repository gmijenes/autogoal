# # Class-based API

# AutoGOAL's class-based API allows to automatically find optimal instances of complex objects
# in user-defined class hierarchies that solve a given task. A task is simply some method that
# evaluates an object's performance. The solution space is defined by a class hierarchy and
# all possible ways of combining instances of different types, and creating them with different parameters.

# !!! note
#     The following code requires `sklearn` dependencies. Read the [dependencies section](/dependencies/) for more information.

# For example, suppose we want to build the best possible classifier in `scikit-learn` for a given dataset.
# Let's begin with a simple classification problem.

from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# We use `make_classification` to create a toy classification problem.

X, y = make_classification(random_state=0)  # Fixed seed for reproducibility

# One first idea is to use a specific algorithm, such as Logistic Regression, to solve this problem.
# Since the nature of these problems is stochastic, we need to train in one subset, test on another,
# and perform a sensible number of evaluations to actually know if this is any good.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

    for i in range(iters):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25)
        estimator.fit(X_train, y_train)
        scores.append(estimator.score(X_test, y_test))

print(score)  # :hide:

# So far so good, but maybe we could do better with a different set of parameters.
# Logistic regression has at least two parameters that influence heavily its performance: the penalty function
# and the regularization strength.

# Instead of writing a loop through a bunch of different parameters, we can use AutoGOAL to automatically
# explore the space of possible combinations.
# We can do this with the class-based API by providing annotations for the parameters we want to explore.

# ## Trying multiple logistic regressions

# First we import some annotation types from AutoGOAL

from autogoal.grammar import ContinuousValue, CategoricalValue

# Next we annotate the parameters we want to explore.
# Since we cannot modify the class `LogisticRegression` we will inherit from it.

# The `penalty: Categorical("l1", "l2")` annotation tells AutoGOAL that for this class the
# parameter `penalty` can take values from a list of predefined values. Likewise the
# `C: Continuous(0.1, 10)` annotation indicates that the parameter `C` can take a float value in a specified range.

# Now we will use AutoGOAL to automatically generate different instances of our `LR` class.
# With the class-based API we achieve this by building a **context-free grammar** that describes all possible instances.

from autogoal.grammar import generate_cfg

grammar = generate_cfg(LR)

# ```bash
# <LR>         := LR (penalty=<LR_penalty>, C=<LR_C>)
# <LR_penalty> := categorical (options=['l1', 'l2'])
# <LR_C>       := continuous (min=0.1, max=10)
# ```

# As you can see, this grammar describes the set of all possible instances of `LR` by
# describing how to call the constructor, and how to generate random values for its parameters.

# !!! note
#     Formally, this a called a **Context-free grammar**. They are used in Computer Science to describe formal languages,
#     such as programming languages, mathematical expresions, etc.
#     Context-free grammars work by describing a set of replacement rules that you can apply recursively to
#     construct a string of a specific language. In this case we are using grammars to describe the language
#     of all possible Python codes that instantiates an `LR`.
#     You can read more in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar).

# You can use this grammar to generate a bunch of random instances.

# LR(C=4.655510386502897, penalty='l2')
# ```

# Now we can search for the best combination of constructor parameters by
# trying a bunch of different instances and see which one obtains the best score.
# AutoGOAL also has tools for automating this process.

from autogoal.search import RandomSearch

search = RandomSearch(grammar, evaluate, random_state=0)  # Fixed seed

# However, maybe we can do even better.

# ## Trying different algorithms

# To continue this line of thought, maybe we could do better with a different classifier.
# We could try decision trees,
# support vector machines, naive bayes, and many more.
# Here is the first time AutoGOAL can come to our aid. Instead of writing ourselves
# a loop through all the possible classes, we can do the following.

# First, we import everything we need.

from sklearn.svm import SVC

from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

# Now that we have all the classes we want to try, we have to tell AutoGOAL that there is something
# to optimize.
# We start by defining a space of possible parameters that we want to tune for each of these
# classes. Like with `LR`, we will wrap these classes in our own to provide the corresponding annotations.

# ```

# !!! note
#     The constructor for `Union` requires as first parameter a `name` so that in the grammar
#     a suitable production can be defined. Think of it as the name of an abstract class that
#     groups all your classes, just there is no actual type ever created, it's just for organizational purposes.

for _ in range(5):

# ```

# So it doesn't really seem that we can do much better, which is unsurprising given that we are only
# doing a random search (there are [better search methods](/api/search/) in AutoGOAL), and this
# is a toy problem which basically any algorithm can solve fairly well.

# However, to continue with the example, now that we know how to optimize any given grammar,
# what is interesting is can we increase the complexity of our pipeline by adding more
# and more layers and steps to it, to solve more challenging problems.

# ## Adding more steps

# To illustrate how to build more complex pipelines, let's change our focus to a bit more challenging problem:
# [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis).
# We will use the ultra-know [movie reviews corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)
# as a testbed in the next few examples.

from autogoal.datasets import movie_reviews

# To solve sentiment analysis we need to add a step before the actual classification in order to get
# feature matrices from text. The simplest solution is to use a vectorizer from `scikit-learn`.
# There are two options to choose from.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# The `CountVectorizer` class has many parameters that we might want to tune, but
# in this example we are interested only in trying different n-gram combinations.
# Hence, we will wrap `CountVectorizer` in our own `Count` class, and redefine its constructor
# to receive an `ngram` parameter. We annotate this parameter with `:Discrete(1,3)` to
# indicate that the possible values are integers in the interval `[1,3]`.

from autogoal.grammar import DiscreteValue


class Count(CountVectorizer):
    def __init__(self, ngram: DiscreteValue(1, 3)):
        super().__init__(ngram_range=(1, ngram))
        self.ngram = ngram


# !!! note
#     The reason why we store `ngram` in the `__init__()` method is
#     for documentation purposes, so that when we call `print()`
#     we get to see the actual parameters that where selected.
#     This works automatically for parameters that are named exactly as `sklearn`
#     parameters, because their `__repr__` takes care, but for parameters which we
#     introduce we need to store them in the instance so that `__repr__` works.

# Now we will do the same with the `TfIdfVectorizer` class, but this time we also want to
# explore automatically whether enabling or disabling `use_idf` is better.
# We will use the `Boolean` annotation in this case.

from autogoal.grammar import BooleanValue


class TfIdf(TfidfVectorizer):
    def __init__(self, ngram: DiscreteValue(1, 3), use_idf: BooleanValue()):
        super().__init__(ngram_range=(1, ngram), use_idf=use_idf)
        self.ngram = ngram


# Besides vectorization, another common step in NLP pipelines is dimensionality reduction.
# For dimensionality reduction, we want to either use singular value decomposition,
# or nothing at all. The implementation of `TruncatedSVD` is suitable here because it
# provides a fast and scalable approximation to SVDs when dealing with spare matrices.
# As before, we want to parameterize the end dimension, so we will use `:Discrete(50,200)`,
# i.e., if we reduce at all, reduce between `50` and `200` dimensions.
# We will use the `Discrete` annotation in this case.

from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD


class SVD(TruncatedSVD):
    def __init__(self, n: DiscreteValue(50, 200)):
        super().__init__(n_components=n)
        self.n = n


# To disable dimensionality reduction in some pipelines, it's not correct to simply pass a `None`
# object. That would raise an exception. Instead, we make use of the
# [*Null Object* design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern)
# and provide a "no-op" implementation that simply passes through the values.


class Noop:
    def fit_transform(self, X, y=None):
        return X

    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        return X

    def __repr__(self):
        return "Noop()"


# !!! note
#     Technically, we could use `"passtrough"` as an argument to the `Pipeline` class that we will
#     use below and achieve the same result. However, this approach is more general and clean, since
#     it doesn't rely on the underlying API providing us with an implementation of the *Null Object* pattern.

# Now that we have all of the necessary classes with their corresponding parameters
# correctly annotated, it's time to put it all together into a pipeline. We will
# inherit from `sklearn`'s own implementation of `Pipeline`, because we want to fix
# the actual steps that are gonna be used.

# Just as before, out initializer declares the parameters. In this case, we
# want a vectorizer, a decomposer and a classifier. To tell `autogoal` to try
# different classes for the same parameter we use the [`Union`](/api/cfg#unions) annotation.
# Likewise, just as before, we have to call the base initializer, this time passing the
# corresponding configuration for an
# [`sklearn` pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html).

# a score. Fortunately, the `movie_reviews.make_fn` function does this for us, taking
# care of train/test splitting, fitting a pipeline in the training set and computing
# the accuracy on the test set.

fitness_fn = movie_reviews.make_fn(examples=100)

# The `RandomSearch` strategy simply calls `grammar.sample()` a bunch of times
# and stores the best performing pipeline. It has no intelligence whatsoever,
# but it serves as a good baseline implementation.

# We will run it for a total of `1000` fitness evaluations, or equivalently, a total
# of `1000` different random pipelines.

random_search = RandomSearch(grammar, fitness_fn, random_state=0)
best, score = random_search.run(1000)

# !!! note
#     For reproducibility purposes we can pass a fixed random seed in `random_state`.

# ## Final remarks

# We only used `scikit-learn` here for illustrative purposes, but you can apply this strategy to any problem
# whose solution consists of exploring a large space of complex class instances interrelated with each other.

# Also, in this example we have manually written wrappers for `scikit-learn` classes to provide the necessary
# annotations. However, specifically for `scikit-learn`, we already provide a bunch of wrappers with suitable
# annotations in [`autogoal.contrib.sklearn`](/api/sklearn/).

# We also only use `RandomSearch` in this example because the focus is on defining the pipelines.
# However, the [`autogoal.search`](/api/search/) namespace contains other search strategies that perform
# much better than plain random sampling.
